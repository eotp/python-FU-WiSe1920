*** 

In order to re-run the class materials I encourage you to use the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager. Once installed, create an environment and install all required dependencies on your machine by typing 

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

into your console (_Windows users: please use the Anaconda Powershell Prompt_). You activate your new environment by typing 

`conda activate fupy` 

Then you are ready to go (if you are stuck check out the [conda documentation site](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)). Alternatively, you may launch [binder](https://mybinder.org/) to get a reproducible executable environment immediately in your browser. Simply click the _launch binder_ icon below.
